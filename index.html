		for your design. With the information that you provide will define the future of your design. So PLEASE do not skim through
		this page. Once all of the information is gathered, please visit our CONTACT page for final the instructions.</p>
	<h3>Before We Start....</h3>
		<p>Please have something ready like a notepad or device to write down any information that is requested. This
			information will later be used to create your design. Any type of media entries will be sent directly to one of our specialists listed
			in our CONTACT page. We suggest that you go through our checklist before any type of entry. Most importantly, should you need
			any further information, please do not hesitate to CONTACT us! One last thing, our team does not like to push ideas on to our 
			customers, we just want to make what our customers want.</p>
	<h3>Why is this so important?</h3>
		<p>Our system is built to evaluate all different types of pictures, area sizes, likes or dislikes, and ideas. Once all of this
